# Turn_Based_Strategy
This project taught me alot about making a list of actions that can be added to and changed easily for later changes.
It taught me about the A* algorithm for AI pathfinding, and it works with the grid system to allow for more structured movement.
The grid system was also alot of fun to learn about, it allows me to show where players can move, use abilities,
and creates the walkable paths based on where environmental objects are placed.
